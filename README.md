# TavelMate
An application that helps short term travelers to be able to interact with their friends during their travel,
and find out where their friends and families visited and recommended. The app is personalized as the user can fill out short personalized categories, and view their social-media friend's reviews and recommendations for travel. <br />
The prototype image is the following: <br />
